About the courses instances, how to activate them.

Two course SUSHI intstances:
•	https://fgcz-course1.bfabric.org/ (fgcz-c-035, faster)
•	https://fgcz-course2.bfabric.org/ (fgcz-h-940, slower, backup server)

Update /srv/sushi/course_sushi/master/config/environments/production.rb - add projects 8000-8013 (that is where all the data is already stored and prepared)
•	just add a project in config.course_users
Then reboot:
•	Normally, passenger-config restart-app (by trxcopy) on 35
•	Secondly (in case of failure passenger-config), sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart (but you should be a sudoer)
